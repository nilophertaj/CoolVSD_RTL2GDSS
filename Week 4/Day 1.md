# üß† CMOS Circuit Design & SPICE Simulation (NMOS Characterization)

This repository covers the **simulation and analysis of NMOS transistor operation** using **NGSPICE** under various regions ‚Äî from resistive to saturation ‚Äî including theoretical background, threshold voltage concepts, and SPICE simulation commands executed in Linux (Ubuntu).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Introduction to Circuit Design & SPICE Simulations

The basic NMOS circuit used for simulation consists of:

- **VDD = 2.5V**
- **Resistor R1 = 550 Œ©**
- **Transistor M1 (NMOS): W/L = 1.8¬µ / 1.2¬µ**
- **Input voltage (Vin) = 2.5V**

**Circuit Diagram Reference:**

### Simulation Parameters:
- \( V_{DD} = 2.5V \)
- \( V_{DS} \): Sweep from **0 ‚Üí 2.5V**
- \( V_{in} \): Applied as gate voltage

## ‚ö° 2. Strong Inversion & Threshold Voltage Concepts

### Threshold Voltage (\(V_T\))

The **threshold voltage** is the minimum gate voltage at which an inversion layer forms at the semiconductor surface.

\[
V_T = V_{TO} + \gamma \left( \sqrt{2\phi_F + V_{SB}} - \sqrt{2\phi_F} \right)
\]

Where:
- \(V_{TO}\): Zero-bias threshold voltage  
- \(\gamma\): Body effect coefficient  
- \(\phi_F\): Fermi potential  
- \(V_{SB}\): Source-to-body voltage

## üîã 3. NMOS Regions of Operation

### (a) Resistive / Linear Region

Occurs when \( V_{DS} < (V_{GS} - V_T) \).

**Condition:**
\[
V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_T
\]

**Drain Current Equation:**
\[
I_D = \mu_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} \left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \right]
\]

**Concepts:**
1. **Drift Current Theory:**  
   Current is mainly due to drift of electrons under electric field \( E \).

2. **Drain Current Model:**  
   Based on gradual channel approximation, voltage varies linearly from source to drain.

3. **SPICE Observation:**  
   For small \(V_{DS}\), the NMOS acts as a **voltage-controlled resistor**.

### (b) Saturation / Pinch-Off Region

Occurs when \( V_{DS} \geq (V_{GS} - V_T) \).

**Condition:**
\[
V_{DS} \geq V_{GS} - V_T
\]

**Drain Current Equation:**
\[
I_D = \frac{1}{2} \mu_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2
\]

**Concept:**
- The channel is pinched off near the drain.
- Current becomes **independent of \(V_{DS}\)** and controlled only by \(V_{GS}\)**.

## üß© 4. Introduction to NGSPICE

**NGSPICE** is an open-source circuit simulator that allows transistor-level simulations and visualization of I‚ÄìV plots.

### Basic SPICE Setup:
- Each device and parameter is described in **SPICE netlist format**.
- Run simulations via Linux terminal using commands.
