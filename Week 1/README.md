# Week 1 â€“ RTL Design & Logic Synthesis Overview  

This repository documents my **Week 1 responsibilities** in the journey of Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis using open-source tools.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of digital logic (`gates`, `flip-flops`, `multiplexers`, etc.)  
- Familiarity with **Linux shell commands**  
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)  
- Tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor

## âœ… Outcome
By the end of Week 1, we will:  
- Understand the **RTL-to-GDS flow (front-end perspective)**  
- Explore **simulation, synthesis, and optimizations**  
- Build confidence in working with **open-source VLSI tools**
