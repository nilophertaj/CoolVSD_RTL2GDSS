Welcome to my learning log for the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** — a step-by-step record of the RTL → synthesis → layout flow using open-source EDA tools. This repository captures setup notes, experiments, screenshots and daily learnings as I progress through the program.

> *In this program we follow a complete SoC design path — from Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design to synthesis, physical design and final GDSII export — using open-source toolchains and practical exercises to build hands-on experience.*
